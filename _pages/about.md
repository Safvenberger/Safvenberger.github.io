Welcome! This blog/webpage was created with the intention to showcase projects
and topics that interest me.  

Who am I? I am a data scientist currently working as a Research Assistant in Hockey Analytics at Linköping University.

The topics most likely to appear on this page are those that interest me the most, 
such as sports analytics (soccer/football and ice hockey), various concepts in 
machine learning, as well as all things data and analytics.

My educational background is a BSc in Statistics and Data Science from Umeå University (2017-2020) and
a MSc in Statistics and Machine Learning from Linköping University (2020-2022).
